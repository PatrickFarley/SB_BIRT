# Welcome to the Secure Browser Implementation Readiness Package (IRP) Application

The Implementation Readiness Package is much like a certification program in that it includes services, sample
content, and test scripts necessary to determine that a secure browser meets the requirements. It differs
from certification in that the emphasis is on self-testing by developers and the generation of a compliance
report.

* Match the updated Secure Browser Requirements including the Secure Browser Launch Protocol.
* Exercise and validate all required and optional Secure Browser APIs.
* Incorporate appropriate HTML support tests as recommended by supplier and approved by UCLASmarter Balanced to evaluate support of the HTML features required by the specification. Options include Acid3 and, HTML5Test. Tests must include support for certain Web Components features to be determined in partnership with Smarter Balanced. Web Component support may be achieved through polyfills.
* Produce an Implementation Readiness Report for any tested browser.
